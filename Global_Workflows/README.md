# Cline Global Workflows

This directory contains universal workflows that apply to all development projects across different technologies and domains.

## Available Global Workflows

### **Development Workflows**
- **`python-testing-workflow.md`** - Comprehensive testing strategy for Python applications using pytest
- **`api-development-workflow.md`** - RESTful API development workflow with Flask and other frameworks
- **`database-migration-workflow.md`** - Safe database schema and data migration procedures

### **Management Workflows**
- **`project-onboarding-workflow.md`** - New team member onboarding and environment setup
- **`monitoring-observability-workflow.md`** - Application monitoring, logging, and alerting setup
- **`workflow-management-guide.md`** - Guide for creating and maintaining workflows

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Global Workflows
- Starting a new project in any technology stack
- Setting up common development processes
- Onboarding new team members
- Implementing monitoring and observability
- Managing databases across projects

### Integration with Workspace Workflows
- Use global workflows as the foundation
- Create workspace-specific workflows for project/technology-specific procedures
- Reference global workflows from workspace workflows when applicable
- Maintain consistency between global and workspace approaches

### Customization
- These workflows are designed to be technology-agnostic where possible
- Adapt commands and tools to your specific technology stack
- Add project-specific details in workspace workflows
- Update global workflows based on lessons learned across projects

## Maintenance
- Review and update workflows quarterly
- Incorporate feedback from multiple projects
- Ensure consistency across all global workflows
- Archive obsolete workflows

## Creating New Global Workflows
1. Ensure the workflow applies to multiple projects/technologies
2. Use the template structure from existing workflows
3. Focus on universal principles and best practices
4. Include examples for multiple technology stacks when relevant
5. Update this README when adding new workflows

## Integration with Cline
- Cline automatically discovers workflows in this directory
- Reference workflows by filename in conversations with Cline
- Use workflows in combination with global rules for complete development guidance
