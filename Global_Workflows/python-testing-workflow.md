# Python Testing Workflow

## Purpose
Comprehensive testing workflow for Python applications, including unit tests, integration tests, and test coverage analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Python environment configured
- Testing framework installed (pytest recommended)
- Coverage tool available (pytest-cov)

## Steps

### 1. Test Setup
```python
# Install testing dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-mock

# Create test directory structure
mkdir tests
mkdir tests/unit
mkdir tests/integration
```

### 2. Write Unit Tests
- Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- Use mocking for external dependencies
- Follow naming convention: `test_<function_name>`
- Aim for 100% code coverage on critical paths

### 3. Write Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Test API endpoints
- Test database operations
- Test file I/O operations

### 4. Run Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### 5. Test Coverage Analysis
- Review HTML coverage report
- Identify untested code paths
- Write additional tests for low coverage areas
- Maintain minimum 80% coverage threshold

### 6. Continuous Testing
- Run tests before each commit
- Set up pre-commit hooks
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor test performance

## Best Practices
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Mock external dependencies
- Regular test maintenance and updates

## Tools
- pytest: Primary testing framework
- pytest-cov: Coverage analysis
- pytest-mock: Mocking utilities
- tox: Testing across Python versions
