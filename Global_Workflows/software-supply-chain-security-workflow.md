# Software Supply Chain Security Workflow

## 1. Vetting New Dependencies
- **Reputation Check:** Before adding a new dependency, verify its publisher, community support, and recent maintenance activity.
- **Vulnerability Scan:** Use `pip-audit` to perform an initial scan.
  ```bash
  pip-audit <package-name>==<version>
  ```

## 2. Continuous Monitoring
- **Automated Scanning:** Integrate dependency scanning into the CI/CD pipeline using tools like `pip-audit`, `Snyk`, or `Dependabot`.
- **Regular Audits:** Run the global `audit_python_project.py` script weekly.

## 3. Incident Response
- **Triage:** If a vulnerability is found, assess its severity and relevance to the project.
- **Remediate:** Prioritize updating the package to a patched version.
- **Document:** Log the vulnerability and the remediation steps taken.
