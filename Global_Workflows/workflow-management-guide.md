# Workflow Management Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to use, create, and maintain workflows in the Cline development environment.
## Workflow Categories

### Global Workflows
Located in Cline's global workflows directory (`C:\Users\devin\Documents\Cline\Workflows\`)
- Apply to all projects universally
- Include general development practices
- Examples: code-review, bug-investigation, feature-development

### Workspace Workflows
Located in project-specific `.clineworkflows` folder
- Apply to specific project or technology stack
- Include project-specific configurations
- Examples: deployment procedures, testing strategies

## Using Workflows

### 1. Identify the Right Workflow
- Check global workflows for general processes
- Look in workspace workflows for project-specific tasks
- Combine multiple workflows when needed

### 2. Follow the Workflow Steps
- Read prerequisites carefully
- Execute steps in order
- Use provided commands and scripts
- Document any deviations or issues

### 3. Customize as Needed
- Adapt steps to your specific situation
- Update environment variables
- Modify commands for your setup
- Note customizations for future reference

## Creating New Workflows

### Template Structure
```markdown

## Prerequisites
- Required tools, access, or setup
- Dependencies that must be met first

## Steps
### 1. Step Name
Detailed instructions for this step

### 2. Next Step
Continue with numbered steps

## Best Practices

### Workflow Types

#### Process Workflows
- Development lifecycle processes
- Code review procedures
- Release management
- Quality assurance

#### Technical Workflows
- Setup and configuration
- Testing procedures
- Deployment processes
- Troubleshooting guides

#### Project-Specific Workflows
- Technology stack procedures
- Environment-specific tasks
- Integration processes
- Custom tooling usage

## Workflow Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- Quarterly workflow review sessions
- Update outdated steps and tools
- Incorporate lessons learned
- Remove obsolete procedures

### Version Control
- Track workflow changes in git
- Document reasons for changes
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Archive old versions if needed

### Team Collaboration
- Share workflow improvements
- Collect feedback from users
- Standardize across teams
- Create training materials

## Best Practices

### Writing Workflows
- Use clear, actionable language
- Include specific commands and examples
- Provide troubleshooting tips
- Test workflows regularly

### Using Workflows
- Read entire workflow before starting
- Prepare all prerequisites
- Follow steps exactly on first use
- Document customizations

### Managing Workflows
- Keep workflows focused and specific
- Avoid duplication between global and workspace workflows
- Regular cleanup of unused workflows
- Maintain clear naming conventions

## Integration with Cline

### Automatic Discovery
- Cline automatically discovers workflows in standard locations
- Use proper naming conventions for easy identification
- Include clear descriptions in workflow headers

### Cross-Referencing
- Reference related workflows in documentation
- Link to global workflows from workspace workflows
- Create workflow chains for complex processes

### Tool Integration
- Use Cline's built-in tools when possible
- Document external tool requirements
- Provide installation instructions for dependencies
